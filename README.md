GraphQL Yoga is a Fully-featured GraphQL Server with a focus on easy setup, performance & great
developer experience:

- **The easiest way to run a GraphQL server:** Sensible defaults & includes everything you need with
  minimal setup (we also export a platform/env-agnostic handler so you can build your wrappers
  easily).
- **Includes Subscriptions:** Built-in support for GraphQL subscriptions using **S**erver-**S**ent
  **E**vents.
- **Compatible:** Works with all GraphQL clients (Apollo, Relay...) and fits seamlessly in your
  GraphQL workflow.
- **WHATWG Fetch API:** the core package depends on
  [WHATWG Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) so it can run and deploy in any environment
  (Serverless, Workers, Deno, Node).
- **Easily Extendable:** New GraphQL-Yoga support all [`envelop`](https://www.envelop.dev) plugins.
- **[Nest](https://nestjs.com/) integration:** support for standalone GraphQL server, Apollo
  Federation (Gateway and service), along with all Nest GraphQL features.
