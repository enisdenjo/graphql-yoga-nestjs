GraphQL Yoga is a Fully-featured GraphQL Server with a focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience:

- **The easiest way to run a GraphQL server:** Sensible defaults & includes everything you need with minimal setup (we also export a platform/env-agnostic handler so you can build your wrappers easily).
- **Includes Subscriptions:** Built-in support for GraphQL subscriptions using **S**erver-**S**ent **E**vents.
- **Compatible:** Works with all GraphQL clients (Apollo, Relay...) and fits seamlessly in your GraphQL workflow.
- **WHATWG Fetch API:** the core package depends on [WHATWG Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) so it can run and deploy in any environment (Serverless, Workers, Deno, Node).
- **Easily Extendable:** New GraphQL-Yoga support all [`envelop`](https://www.envelop.dev) plugins.
- **[Nest](https://nestjs.com/) integration:** support for standalone GraphQL server, Apollo Federation (Gateway and service), along with all Nest GraphQL features.
